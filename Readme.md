# LED Board in action
We could not collect the Stemma QT breakout cable, so we decided to use some other GPIOs, we decided to have some fun with the LEDs, and made a morse code display, with the letters DALTON spelled out. the Blue LED indicates the start of every character and Red LED indicates the actual morse code.

# Proposal for Board Expansion
For our final project we plan to use a button somewhere, not yet sure where we are going to use it, so for the expansion module we plan to make a button input module, with pull up and pull down settings using berg pins we also added two LEDs for some indication if needed.
